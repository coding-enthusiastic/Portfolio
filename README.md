# Personal Portfolio (Version 2)

This is the second version of my portfolio website, made with Next.js and modern CSS framework Tailwind CSS. I put it together to introduce myself, share a bit about what I’ve worked on, and just start putting my stuff out there. It’s simple, clean, and built from scratch while I was learning the basics of modern frontend development. Learnt a lot from this project and still figuring things out, but this the way to learn new tools and technologies.
