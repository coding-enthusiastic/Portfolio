# Personal Portfolio

This is the first portfolio website I’ve ever built — my personal portfolio, made with React + Vite and good old CSS. I put it together to introduce myself, share a bit about what I’ve worked on, and just start putting my stuff out there. It’s simple, clean, and built from scratch while I was learning the basics of modern frontend development. Learnt a lot from React and still figuring things out, but this was a fun first step into the dev world.

Since it is my learning journey, I want to improve it however I can. Wish me luck to achieve this small goal of mine...
